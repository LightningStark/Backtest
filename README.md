# Backtest Historical stock market data for Intraday Trades 

Stock market data Backtesting to develop and Test Trading Strategy for Intraday Trades, 
Historical data of stocks were downloaded from India Stock Exchange's website.
This software was made only for personal use, currently I have no intentions of scaling it (improved version, Ofcourse!) for commercial purpose.  
To create your own strategy create new files similar to - 'Pinbar/HangingMan/BearEngulg/BullEnguls'.py, and add to Main.py

To execute the code successfully
1. run Main.py with python >3.0 interpreter 
2. required python packages: pandas, PyQt5



versions:

>Alpha version - first implemantation of gui with Tkinkter

>Beta Version(current) - Better Gui with PyQt5

future updates 

1. removal of stock enteries with no trades, currently you will observe there are stocks on output window with corresponding empty cells
2. create and save new strategies
3. swing trading(Long Position - holding stock position more for than one day) with moving averages(MA)
